         -to RAM (Oracle Restart) Between 8 GB and 16 GB: Equal to the size of the RAM <br>
         -More than 16 GB: 16 GB <br>
         Note: If you enable HugePages for your Linux servers, then you should deduct the memory allocated to HugePages from the available RAM before calculating swap space.
